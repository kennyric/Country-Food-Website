	<h1 style="background-color:gray; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">History of Equatorial Guinea</h1>

	<p style="background-color:#FAFAFA; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">The colonial history of Equatorial Guinea 
	dates back to 1471 when Portuguese explorers descended on the country. On their way to India, Portuguese explorers discovered the island 
	of Bioko, and later colonized the islands of Fernando Poo and Annobon. They retained control of Equatorial Guinea until 1778, when the 
	territory was ceded to Spain in exchange for land in South America. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1820, rebel forces took control
	of the colony. The mainland of Equatorial Guinea became a Spanish colony in 1900.
	With increasing nationalist sentiment and escalating pressure from the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the journey to independence was underway.
	On 12 October 1968, Equatorial Guinea became an independent state with Francisco Macias Nguema as the first President.</p>

	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Early Kingdoms in the Region:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">The first inhabitants of the region [now Equatorial Guinea] are believed to have been Pygmies, of whom only isolated pockets remain in northern Rio Muni.
	Bantu migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal tribes and later the Fang. Elements of Fang may have generated the Bubi, who immigrated
	to Bioko from Cameroon and Rio Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The Annobon population, native to Angola, was introduced by the 
	Portuguese via Sao Tome.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Europeans 'Discover' the Island of Formosa:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">The Portuguese explorer, Fernando Po (Fernao do Poo), seeking a route to India, is credited with having discovered the island of Bioko in 1471. He called it Formosa 
	("pretty flower"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer [it is now known as Bioko]. The Portuguese retained control until 1778, when the island,
	adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the mainland between the Niger and Ogoue Rivers were ceded to Spain in exchange for territory in South America (Treaty of Pardo).</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Europeans Stake Their Claim:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS">From 1827 to 1843, Britain established a base on the island to combat the slave trade. The Treaty of Paris settled conflicting claims to the mainland in 1900, and periodically, 
	the mainland territories were united administratively under Spanish rule. Spain lacked the wealth and the interest to develop an extensive economic infrastructure in what was 
	commonly known as Spanish Guinea during the first half of this century.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">An Economic Powerhouse:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Through a paternalistic system, particularly on Bioko Island, Spain developed large cacao plantations for which thousands of Nigerian workers were imported as laborers. 
	At independence in 1968, largely as a result of this system, Equatorial Guinea had one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa. The Spanish also helped Equatorial Guinea 
	achieve one of the continent's highest literacy rates and developed a good network of health care facilities.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">A Province of Spain:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">In 1959, the Spanish territory of the Gulf of Guinea was established with status similar to the provinces of metropolitan Spain. The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the Spanish parliament. Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Equatorial Guinea Gains Independence from Spain:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Although Spain's commissioner-general had extensive powers, the Equatorial Guinean General Assembly had considerable initiative in formulating laws and regulations. In March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the United Nations, Spain announced forthcoming independence for Equatorial Guinea. In the presence of a UN observer team, a referendum was held on August 11, 1968, and 63% of the electorate voted in favor of a new constitution, a General Assembly, and a Supreme Court.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">President-for-Life Nguema:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Francisco Macias Nguema was elected first president of Equatorial Guinea - independence was granted on 12 October. In July 1970, Macias created a single-party state and by May 1971, key portions of the constitution were abrogated. In 1972 Macias took complete control of the government and became 'President-for-Life'. His regime effectively abandoned all government functions except internal security, run by terror squads. The result was one-third of the country's population dead or in exile.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Equatorial Guinea's Economic Decline and Fall:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Due to pilferage, ignorance, and neglect, the country's infrastructure--electrical, water, road, transportation, and health--fell into ruin. Religion was repressed, and education ceased. The private and public sectors of the economy were devastated. Nigerian contract laborers on Bioko, estimated to have been 60,000, left en masse in early 1976. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Coup d'Etat:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">In August 1979, Macias' nephew from Mongomo and former director of the infamous Black Beach prison, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, led a successful coup d'etat. Macias was arrested, tried, and executed and Obiang assumed the Presidency in October 1979. Obiang initially ruled Equatorial Guinea with the assistance of a Supreme Military Council. In 1982 a new constitution was drafted, with the help of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which came into effect on August 15 - the Council was abolished</p>
	
	<h2 style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-family:Comic Sans MS">Ending a One Party State?:</h2>
	<p style="background-color:#fafafa; color:black; font-size:150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS;">Obiang was reelected in 1989 and again in February 1996 (with 98% of the vote). In 1996, however, several opponents withdrew from the race, and international observers criticized the election. Obiang subsequently named a new cabinet which included some opposition figures in minor portfolios.

Despite the formal ending of one-party rule in 1991, President Obiang and a circle of advisors (drawn largely from his own family and ethnic group) maintain real authority. The President names and dismisses cabinet members and judges, ratifies treaties, leads the armed forces, and has considerable authority in other areas. He appoints the governors of Equatorial Guinea's seven provinces.

The opposition had few electoral successes in the 1990s. By early 2000, President Obiang’s Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (Partido Democrático de Guinea Ecuatorial, PDGE) fully dominated government at all levels. In December 2002, President Obiang won a new seven-year mandate with 97% of the vote. Reportedly, 95% of eligible voters voted in this election, although many observers noted numerous irregularities.</p>
